Changes in lqmm

=============================================

Version 1.0 (April 29, 2012)

- Package lqmm on CRAN

=============================================

Version 1.01 (May 30, 2012)

- Added functions
- Fixed bugs in ll_h_R and ll_h_d (lqmm.c)
- Amended cov.sel (lqmm.R) and psi_mat (lqmm.c)

=============================================

Version 1.02 (September 15, 2012)

- Changed lqmControl and lqmmControl parameters (less stringent convergence thresholds) (lqmm.R)
- Changed quadrature default in lqmm (lqmm.R)
- Changed to the function boot.lqmm (lqmm.R) which provides bootstrapped standard errors of the coefficients estimates. The starting values used in each bootstrap sample are by default those from a least squares fit (startQR = FALSE). In previous versions of the package, starting values were taken from the fitted object (startQR = TRUE) to speed up convergence in each bootstrap sample. However, this causes the standard errors to be under-estimated

=============================================

Version 1.03 (April 30, 2013)

- Improved documentation
- Changed default lqmmControl(method = "df") to lqmmControl(method = "gs") (lqmm.R)
- References updated
- Fixed bug in covHandling (lqmm.R)
- Produce warning when likelihood ratio test is negative
